/**
 * ZHL16C.java <br/>
 *
 * Represents a Buhlmann model.<br/>
 * Composed of a tissue array of Compartment[]<br/>
 * Has an OxTox and Gradient object <br/>
 * Can throw a ModelStateException propagated from a Compartment if pressures or time is out of bounds.<br/>
 * 
 * ZHL16C can be initialised from scratch or may be rebuilt from a saved ZHL16BModel via the ModelDAO class. <br/>
 * Models are initialised by initModel() if they are new models, or<br/>
 * validated by validateModel() if they are rebuild from a saved model.<br/> 
 * 
 * The model is capable of ascending or descending via ascDec() using the ascDec() method of Compartment,<br/>
 * or accounting for a constant depth using the constDepth() method of Compartment.<br/>
