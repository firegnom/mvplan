mvplan.conditions.heading.text = CONDITIONS OF USE
mvplan.conditions.text=Use of this software is governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia.\n\n\
This software is provided free of charge for experienced mixed gas rebreather divers to evaluate m-value gradient profiles based on Erik Baker's m-value gradient calculations and the Buhlmann ZHL16-B/C decompression model.\
This software is experimental, it probably contains bugs and should not be relied upon for actual dives. Use it at your own risk.\n\n\
WARNING\nIf you follow dive schedules generated by this software you could suffer decompression sickness, serious injury or possibly death.\
The author does not warrant that this software accurately reflects Buhlmann's algorithms, or that it will produce safe, reliable, results.\n\n\
Diving in general is fraught with risk, and decompression diving using mixed gases and rebreathers adds significantly more risk.\
This software is not intended for uneducated users. This software and the decompression schedules it produces are tools for experienced mixed-gas rebreather decompression divers only. If you have not been properly trained in mixed-gas rebreather decompression diving by an internationally recognized technical certification agency and/or don't have a firm handle on decompression planning and mixed-gas diving, DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE OR THE DIVE SCHEDULES CREATED BY IT.\n\n\
